What is this repository?
----

It's a repository filled with small scripts, often written in an 
afternoon/night or two to fill a specific task or just to do something 
fun. Often these are fun, but aren't big enough or supported enough to 
have their own repository. So, they're combined here.

Your're welcome to poke around!
